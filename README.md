This project was part of the Data Management & SQL course in MsBA program at Hult International Business School.

The accounting database was provided by the instructor.

**Course Description**

Understanding and analyzing data is a critical component of business decision-making. In order for data to lead to actionable insights, 
one must understand how to manage data in a relational database system and turn the data into purposeful information. 
This course will offer an overview of relational databases, methodologies for selecting and summarizing columns from database tables, 
and the use of comparison operators to combine multiple data criteria. Additional topics include the use of aggregate functions and sorting, 
grouping, and joins will also be introduced. Students will also develop basic applied proficiency in using Structured Query Language, or SQL, 
which is a standard database management language widely used for manipulation of data in relational databases, and is particularly helpful in retrieving data from their native environments.
